# GCP Service Account Naming Enforcer üõ°Ô∏è (Terraform Module)

This module enforces a consistent naming standard for Google Cloud Platform Service Accounts. It generates and validates `account_id`s according to predefined rules, ensuring compliance with GCP's 30-character limit and promoting clear resource identification across your infrastructure.

## The Standard: Required Format üéØ

All Service Accounts will adhere to this format:

`[domain]-[component]-[purpose]-[env]-[suffix]`

### Component Breakdown:

*   **`[domain]`**: Identifies the primary logical grouping, application, or stack (e.g., `apps`, `ml`, `admin`). Abbreviate only if the total name exceeds 30 characters. Ensure consistency in abbreviations. üß†
*   **`[component]`**: Describes the specific service, microservice, or function utilizing this SA (e.g., `web-fe`, `data-proc`, `llm-proxy`). **This is the FIRST component to abbreviate** if the total name approaches or exceeds the 30-character limit.
*   **`[purpose]`**: Indicates the SA's primary role or critical permissions (e.g., `reader`, `invoker`, `admin`). **This is the SECOND component to abbreviate** if shortening `[component]` was insufficient. Use clear abbreviations (`read`, `exec`).
*   **`[env]`**: Identifies the environment (e.g., `prod`, `stg`, `dev`).
*   **`[suffix]`**: Explicitly marks the resource type based on `sa_type`.
    *   `-sa`: For standard Service Accounts.
    *   `-federated-user`: For Service Accounts used with Workload Identity Federation.

### Naming Process:

1.  Draft the full name using all components.
2.  **Validate the length.** If `<= 30 characters`, proceed.
3.  **If `> 30 characters`:**
    1.  Abbreviate `[component]` as much as possible while retaining clarity.
    2.  If still exceeding 30 characters, then abbreviate `[domain]`.
    3.  As a final resort, abbreviate `[purpose]`.

## Enforcement Rules:

This module validates generated `account_id`s against strict rules:

*   **30-Character Limit:** Terraform will fail if any generated `account_id` exceeds GCP's 30-character limit. The error message will explicitly state the offending name and its length. The responsibility for abbreviation to meet this limit lies with the user's input. üí•
*   **Suffix Control:** The `sa_type` variable determines the correct suffix. The `add_suffix_by_this_module` variable allows bypassing suffix generation by this module if an external process handles it. However, the 30-character validation will still apply to the resulting name. üß†

## How to Use:

Provide a map of your Service Account definitions. This module will return a map of validated `account_id`s. These IDs are then used to instantiate `google_service_account` resources.

## Inputs:

*   `service_accounts` (map of objects): A map of Service Account definitions. Each object requires:
    *   `domain` (string): The primary logical grouping or application stack
    *   `component` (string): The specific service or microservice
    *   `purpose` (string): The Service Account's primary role or permissions
    *   `env` (string): The environment identifier
    *   `sa_type` (string, optional, default `standard`): Allowed values: `"standard"` or `"federated"`.
    *   `add_suffix_by_this_module` (bool, optional, default `true`): Set to `false` if the suffix is managed externally.
    *   `description` (string, optional): Used for the final `google_service_account` resource's description.
    *   `labels` (map, optional): Used for the final `google_service_account` resource's labels.

## Outputs:

*   `service_account_ids` (map of strings): A map containing all generated `account_id`s, validated against the 30-character limit. These are ready for use in creating `google_service_account` resources.
